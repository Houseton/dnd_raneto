# DND 5e Resources

This is a personal compilation of resources for DND 5e including text of the official sourcebooks. It is written in markdown and set up to be converted to static HTML with ``raneto`` (installed by the command ``npm install -g raneto``).

##Dependencies

- [Raneto](http://raneto.com/)

## Example Installation

```bash
\# npm install -g raneto
\# mv /usr/lib/node_modules/raneto/content{,-backup}
\# cp -r content /usr/lib/node_modules/raneto/content
\# cd /usr/lib/node_modules/raneto
\# npm start
```

This creates an easy to use reference system for D&D Next at whatever site you're hosting this, including a localhost.
