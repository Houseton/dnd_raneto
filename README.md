DND 5e Resources
================

This is a personal compilation of resources for DND 5e including text of the official sourcebooks. It is written in markdown and set up to be converted to static HTML with `raneto` (installed by the command `npm install -g raneto`).

##Dependencies

-	[Raneto](http://raneto.com/)

Example Installation
--------------------

```bash
# npm install -g raneto
# mv /usr/lib/node_modules/raneto/content{,-backup}
# ln -s /path/to/git/clone/content /usr/lib/node_modules/raneto/content
# cd /usr/lib/node_modules/raneto
# npm start
```

This creates an easy to use reference system for D&D Next at whatever site you're hosting this, including a localhost. It also allows you to just go into the cloned folder, do a `git pull` and not have to touch anything else.
